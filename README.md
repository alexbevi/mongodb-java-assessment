* Spring Web
* Spring Data MongoDB
* Spring Boot DevTools
* Lombok

## Purpose

This project can be used during a technical interview to assess the Java programming capabilities of a candidate. Successful completion of the assessment would result in a web application that can create new named items and descriptions, which can also be filtered.

## Tasks

* Configure the Spring Data MongoDB application with the provided connection string
* Review the application structure and explain how the various Spring Data components fit together
* Setup the `Item` model with appropriate property accessors
* Using Maven or Gradle, build and start the application and navigate to http://localhost:8080 to verify it works
* Create a couple items via the UI
* Inspect the backing JavaScript file to identify what API call is used for searching, then work backwards to enable this functionality
* Using the API, list all created items
* Create an API method for deleting an item by Id, then delete an item using this API
